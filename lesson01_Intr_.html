## Ten Principles of Economics

In this chapter, you will be able to answer the following questions:

+  What kinds of questions does economics address?

+  What are the principles of how people make decisions? 

+  What are the principles of how people interact?

+  What are the principles of how the economy as a whole works?

+  What is the difference between microeconomics &amp; Macroeconomics?

---

## What Economics Is All About 

+ ***Scarcity:***  the limited nature of society's resources (labor, land, physical capital)

+ ***Economics:***  the study of how society manages its scarce resources.

## The principles of ***HOW PEOPLE  MAKE DECISIONS***

&lt;!-- ![](imgs/Ch01_fig1a.jpg){fig.width=100%} --&gt;

### Principle \#1. Because Resources are scarce, People Face Trade-offs 

All decisions involve tradeoffs. Examples:

+  Students face trade-offs: 

+  Farmers face trade-offs: producing more of apple vs. more of oranges

+  Governments face trade-offs: more butter versus guns

			
---

## Principle 1: Because Resources are scarce, People Face Trade-offs
        
+  Society faces an important trade-off between ***efficiency vs. equity (equality):***

    - ***Efficiency:***  when society gets the most from its scarce resources

    - ***Equity:***  when prosperity is distributed uniformly or *fairly* among society's members

+  Tradeoff:  To achieve greater equality, society could redistribute income from wealthy to poor. But this reduces incentive to work and produce, shrinks the size of the economic *pie.* 

			
---

## Principle 2:  The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It 

+  Making decisions requires comparing the costs and benefits of alternative choices. 

+  The ***opportunity cost*** of any item is whatever must be given up to obtain it.  

  - It is the relevant cost for decision making.

			
---

## Principle 2:  The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It 

What is the opportunity cost of

+  going to college?

+  seeing a movie?

			
---

## Principle 3: Rational People Think at the Margin

 

+  Economists assume that people are rational since they systematically and purposefully do the best they can to achieve their objectives.

+  Or make decisions by evaluating marginal cost and marginal benefits; 
  - ***Marginal Changes*** – incremental adjustments to an existing plan.

+  Ignore ***Sunk Cost*** – cost already incurred and cannot be recovered.

			
---

## Principle 3:  Rational People Think at the Margin  
Examples:  

+  A student considering whether to go to college compares

+  When a manager considers whether to increase output, she compares

---

## Principle 4:  People Respond to Incentives  


+  ***Incentive:***  something that induces a person to act, i.e. the prospect of a reward or punishment. 

&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
+  Rational people respond to incentives.

			
---

## ACTIVE LEARNING 1: APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES  

***Example 1:*** You are selling your 1996 Mustang.  You have already spent \$1000 on repairs.  
At the last minute, the transmission dies.  You can pay \$ 600 to have it repaired, or sell the car *as is.* 
In each of the following scenarios, should you have the transmission repaired?  Explain.

a. Blue book value is \$ 6500 if transmission works, \$ 5700 if it doesn't

b.  Blue book value is \$ 6000 if transmission works, \$ 5500 if it doesn't

 

 

---

## ACTIVE LEARNING 2: APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES 
Jim and Mike are roommates with the same taste for Jazz. Jim wins a ticket from a Radio station to see the jazz band perform at an outdoor concert. Mike has paid \$20 for a ticket to the same concert. Both tickets are non-refundable. Due to a tremendous thunderstorm, they are reconsidering their attending the concert. Who do you think will be more likely to attend the concert, assuming that both are rational? Explain why.

			
---

## ACTIVE LEARNING 3: APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES  
Suppose you won a  ticket from a Radio station to see a jazz band perform at an outdoor concert. But while preparing to go to the concert today, it rains and you decide not to go. Suppose you had paid \$500  for the ticket instead of getting it for free, what would be the rational decision for you to do now: go or not go to the concert?

## The principles of HOW PEOPLE INTERACT

&lt;!-- ![](imgs/Ch01_fig2.jpg){fig.width=100%} --&gt;

## Principle 5:  Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off 

+  Rather than being self-sufficient, people can specialize in producing one good or service and exchange it for other goods.  

+  Countries also benefit from trade &amp; specialization:
    - Get a better price abroad for goods they produce
    - Buy other goods more cheaply from abroad than could be produced at home

---

## Principle 6:  Markets Are Usually A Good Way to Organize Economic Activity

+  *** Market:***  a group of buyers and sellers (not necessarily a place)

+  ***Organize economic activity*** means determining:
    - what (and how much) g &amp; s to produce
    - how to produce them  
    - For Whom to produce: who gets them

+  These are the 3 economic problems every society must solve.

			
---

## Principle 6:  Markets Are Usually A Good Way to Organize Economic Activity 

+ A ***market economy***, unlike ***command economy***, allocates resources through the decentralized decisions of many households and firms as they interact in markets.

+ Famous insight by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations (1776): "Each of these households and firms acts as if *led by an invisible hand* to promote general economic well- being."

			
---

## Principle 6:  Markets Are Usually A Good Way to Organize Economic Activity 
The invisible hand works through the price system:
 
+  The interaction of buyers and sellers determines prices.  

+  Each price reflects the good's value to buyers and the cost of producing the good. 
+  Prices guide self-interested households and firms to make decisions that, in many cases, maximize society's economic well-being (i.e., efficient). 

---

## Principle 6:  Markets Are Usually A Good Way to Organize Economic Activity 

+  For the market mechanism to work, it needs the govt to ***enforce property rights*** (with police, courts, even the military)

+  People are less inclined to work, produce, invest, or purchase if there is large risk of their property being stolen

+  Even with proper enforcement of property rights, a market mechanism can sometimes lead to inefficient allocation of resources \ldots

 

---

## Principle 7 :  Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes 

+ ***Market failure:***  when the market fails to allocate society's resources efficiently.

+ 3 Causes of market failure:

  1. &lt;u&gt;Externalities&lt;/u&gt;, when the production or consumption of a good affects bystanders (e.g. pollution)
  
  2. &lt;u&gt;Market power&lt;/u&gt;, a single buyer or seller has substantial influence on market price (e.g. monopoly)
  
	3. &lt;u&gt;Public goods:&lt;/u&gt; defense services, parks, etc.

+  In such cases, well designed public policies may promote efficiency

---

## Principle 7:  Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes 

+  Govt may alter market outcome to ***promote equity***

+ If the market's distribution of economic well-being is not desirable, tax or welfare policies can change how the economic *pie* is divided. 

---

## Discussion Questions   

In each of the following situations, what is the government's role?  Does the government's intervention improve the outcome?

a. Public schools for K-12

b. Public highways

c. Patent laws, which allow drug companies to charge high prices for life-saving drugs

---

## Two Broad Branches of Economics 

+ ***Microeconomics:*** branch of economics concerned with how people make decisions and how these decisions interact.
    - e.g., determination of price, employment or output in a particular market or industry.

+  ***Macroeconomics:*** branch of economics concerned with the overall economy. 
    - e.g., determination of national income, economic growth, recessions, inflation.

## The principles of HOW THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE WORKS 

&lt;!-- ![](imgs/Ch01_fig3.jpg) --&gt;

### Principle 8: A Country's Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods &amp; Services 

+  The most important determinant of living standards:  ***productivity***, the amount of goods and services produced per unit of labor.   

+  Productivity depends on the equipment, skills, and technology available to workers.

+  Other factors (e.g., labor unions, competition from abroad) have far less impact on living standards.

			
---

## Principle 9: Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money 

+  Inflation:  increase in the general level of prices.  

+  In the long run, inflation is almost always caused by excessive growth in the quantity of money, which causes the value of money to fall.  

+  The faster the govt creates money, the greater the inflation rate.

---

## ***Principle 10:*** Society Faces a Short-run Tradeoff Between Inflation and Unemployment

+  In the short-run (1–2 years), many economic policies push inflation and unemployment in opposite directions.  

+  Other factors can make this tradeoff more or less favorable, but the tradeoff is always present.
