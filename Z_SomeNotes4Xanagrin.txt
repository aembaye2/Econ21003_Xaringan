# image can be inserted by:

![](path)  but {height, width =?} doesn't work

** Don't forget to put the image extensions .png, .jpg . without those it doesn't work

So the best way so far is to create yaml after --- but before the ## :

background-image: url("imgs/Ch01_figxx.png")
background-position: 50% 90%
class: white
background-size: 75% 75%

background-position: are the x and y axis values; y values are from top to bottom like javascript plane

background-size: 
In Xaringan presentations, the `background-size` property can be used to control how a background image is displayed. Here are the common options for `background-size`:

1. **cover**: Scales the background image to cover the entire slide, maintaining the aspect ratio. Parts of the image may be cropped to fit.
2. **contain**: Scales the background image to fit within the slide, maintaining the aspect ratio. The entire image will be visible, but there may be empty space around it.
3. **auto**: The background image is displayed at its original size.
4. **percentage values**: You can specify width and height as percentages (e.g., `50% 50%`).
5. **length values**: You can specify width and height in units like pixels (e.g., `100px 100px`).
